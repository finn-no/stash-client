# Stash::Client

Very basic client for the Atlassian Stash REST API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'stash-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stash-client

## Usage

```ruby
client = Stash::Client.new(host: 'git.example.com', credentials: 'user:pass')
client.projects #=> [{'name' => 'foo', ...}]

repo = client.repositories.first              #=> {'name' => 'bar', ...}
repo = client.repositories_for(project).first #=> {'name' => 'bar', ...}

commits = client.commits_for(repo, since: 'e6c0a79734b3c1fa5c30c4c83cd3220e36d7e246')
commits = client.commits_for(repo, limit: 100)
```
